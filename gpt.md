# Smart Recipe Generator Project Summary

## Project Overview
The Smart Recipe Generator is a web application built using a Node.js-based stack with MongoDB as data storage and Next.js. The app includes ingredient input with quantity and type, dietary preference selection, AI-generated recipes with step-by-step instructions, and user ratings and feedback on recipes. The app is built using TypeScript and utilizes Git for version control.

## Key Features
1. **Ingredient Input:** Users can select ingredients from a predefined list.
2. **Dietary Preferences:** Users can select dietary preferences which are taken into account when generating recipes.
3. **Recipe Generation:** AI-generated recipes based on selected ingredients and dietary preferences.
4. **Recipe Display:** Recipes are displayed in a card format with details about ingredients, instructions, and additional information.
5. **User Authentication:** Google authentication implemented using `next-auth`.
6. **Image Generation:** Images for recipes generated using OpenAI and uploaded to S3.
7. **Profile Component:** Display all recipes created by the user and other user-specific data.

## Components
### Ingredient Input
- **Status:** Implemented and working.
- **Details:** Users select ingredients from a dropdown and optionally specify quantities.

### Dietary Preferences
- **Status:** Implemented and working.
- **Details:** Users select dietary preferences which are used to filter recipe generation.

### Recipe Generation
- **Status:** Implemented and working.
- **Details:** Recipes are generated using OpenAI based on user inputs and dietary preferences.

### Recipe Display
- **Status:** Implemented and working.
- **Details:** Recipes are displayed with ingredients, instructions, and additional information. Hover effects added for better UI/UX.

### User Authentication
- **Status:** Implemented and working.
- **Details:** Google authentication using `next-auth`. Users are redirected to the main page upon login.

### Image Generation
- **Status:** Implemented and working.
- **Details:** Images are generated using OpenAI and uploaded to S3. Images are displayed alongside recipes.

### Profile Component
- **Status:** In progress.
- **Details:** Will display all recipes created by the user and other user-specific data in the future.

## Project Status
- **Ingredient Input:** Completed
- **Dietary Preferences:** Completed
- **Recipe Generation:** Completed
- **Recipe Display:** Completed
- **User Authentication:** Completed
- **Image Generation:** Completed
- **Profile Component:** In progress

## Next Steps
- Complete the Profile Component to display user-specific data.
- Implement user feedback and rating system for recipes.
- Optimize the application for better performance.
- Conduct thorough testing and debugging to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Current Issues
- The "Profile Component" is still under development.
- Need to refine the styling of certain components for better user experience.
- Optimize the API calls to reduce latency and improve performance.

## Conclusion
The Smart Recipe Generator project is nearing completion with most of the key features implemented and working. The current focus is on developing the Profile Component and refining the user interface for a better user experience.
